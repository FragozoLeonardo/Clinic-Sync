## ClinicSync - Flow Chart Explanation

![ClinicSync Flow Chart](https://postimg.cc/zbXc5TwD)

This flowchart presents the core logic of the **ClinicSync** system, a role-based medical management platform. Below is a detailed breakdown of each flow:

---

### 1. **User Login**

- The user starts by logging in with their credentials.
- The system checks if the login is valid:
  - If invalid → error message is displayed.
  - If valid → redirects to the correct dashboard based on the user's role: **Admin**, **Secretary**, **Doctor**, or **Patient**.

---

### 2. **Admin Panel**

Admins have full access to system configuration. They can:
- Create and manage users (Admins, Secretaries, Doctors).
- Modify system-wide settings.
- View and generate reports.
- Access all areas of the platform.

---

### 3. **Secretary Dashboard**

Secretaries are responsible for clinic organization. Their main tasks include:
- Registering new patients.
- Scheduling and rescheduling appointments.
- Managing the appointment calendar.
- Communicating with doctors about schedules.

---

### 4. **Doctor Dashboard**

Doctors are focused on clinical work. They can:
- View scheduled appointments.
- Access and update patient records.
- Write prescriptions.
- Request and review lab or imaging exams.

---

### 5. **Shared Tasks – Secretary & Doctor**

Both roles collaborate on several actions:
- Viewing patient details.
- Accessing and updating appointment statuses.
- Coordinating exams or treatment steps.
- Adding notes to medical history (with different levels of permission).

---

### 6. **Patient Area**

Patients (when logged in or handled by staff) can:
- Be registered by the secretary.
- View their scheduled appointments.
- Receive prescription printouts or exam requests.
- Have a growing medical record accessible to doctors.

---

### 7. **Security & Database Layer**

- All data is securely stored and encrypted.
- Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- Logs track critical actions for auditing and accountability.

---

### 8. **Logout / End Session**

All users can securely log out to end their session. Session data is cleared to prevent unauthorized access.

---

This flow ensures that **ClinicSync** runs with clarity, role-based access, and seamless collaboration between staff and patients, enhancing operational efficiency and data security in medical environments.
